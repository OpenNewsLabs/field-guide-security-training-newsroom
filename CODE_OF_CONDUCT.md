# Code of Conduct

This project actively encourages contributions from people of all genders and statuses, races, ethnicities, ages, creeds, nationalities, persuasions, alignments, sizes, shapes, and journalistic affiliations. You are welcome here. By participating in this project, you are agreeing to abide by its code of conduct.

OpenNews is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-free environment. This project exists in a public space, so we think it's particularly important to identify our principles in creating a supportive community.

Participants in this project agree to:

* Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow contributors.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: 
    * deliberate intimidation; 
    * sustained or willful disruption of conversations or other work; 
    * use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; 
    * and unwelcome sexual attention.
* Be welcoming, friendly, patient, and kind. Ask questions. In disagreement or critique, explain why you feel the way you do, and recognize that other contributors also make decisions with good intentions and the best information available to them.

If anyone violates this code of conduct, project coordinators may take any action we deem appropriate, including but not limited to warning the participant or banning them from contribution.

Instances of abuse, harassment, or other unacceptable behavior may be reported by emailing <info@opennews.org>, an address that reaches all OpenNews staff members.
