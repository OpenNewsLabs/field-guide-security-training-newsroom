# Contributing to The Field Guide to Security Training In The Newsroom

The Field Guide is a collaborative project. It gets better every time anyone from the journalism, tech, and security communities shares advice, writes up an experience, asks a question, or even just spots a typo. We'd love to add your voice to this project.

## Who should contribute

This project actively encourages contributions from people of all genders and statuses, races, ethnicities, ages, creeds, nationalities, persuasions, alignments, sizes, shapes, and journalistic affiliations. You are welcome here. By participating in this project, you are agreeing to abide by its [code of conduct](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/field-guide-security-training-newsroom/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please report unacceptable behaviour to [fieldguide@opennews.org](mailto:fieldguide@opennews.org)

The curriculum also benefits from contributors of all skill levels. Sharing a resource that helped you understand something for the first time is awesome. Telling everyone about a training game your colleagues loved is awesome, too. And so is just asking a question, as you think about how your newsroom can better protect its journalists and sources.

If you're wondering what you might be able to offer this project, here are a few questions to get you started:

* Could you read through a lesson plan and tell us what seems helpful and what's confusing?
* Could you write up a case study about a security situation you've run into?
* Could you describe the cultural roadblocks you've run into trying to bring more security to your newsroom, and how you've pushed through them?
* Could you help add checklists at the ends of lessons?
* Could you describe how security needs might be different in different countries, or work on translating documentation into another language?

Even just adding a quick link or two is a great way to contribute. If you've got a timely article or an old favorite that really captures the value of taking a lesson seriously, those add fantastic context. We don't want to duplicate work that other people have done better already, and we recognize that this is just one of many great resources. So if you know of a great lesson plan or walkthrough somewhere else, there's a section in each lesson for links, and [our resource guide](https://securitytraining.opennews.org/en/latest/Chapter03-01-Resources.html) is an excellent spot for links that don't fit a specific lesson. Share your favorites.

And one more way to help us make this project even better:

* Try out one of these lesson plans and let us know how it goes!

More than anything, we want this curriculum to be useful to people as they help their colleagues get better at security. We'd love to hear how well these lessons work in _your_ newsroom, and what we can do to improve them.

### Send us feedback
Have you used The Field Guide to Security Training in the Newsroom to lead a workshop in your newsroom? We'd love to hear about it. 

### Write new lesson plans
As new tools are developed and new threats emerge, lesson plans will be added to the guide to cover them. If you want to get started on a lesson plan right away, please start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/newsroom-security-curricula/issues/new). If you're comfortable with git and Markdown, the best way to submit changes is to fork this project and [open a pull request](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/newsroom-security-curricula/compare). If git is not your thing, you can write your lesson plans in your editor of choice and send them to us at [fieldguide@opennews.org](mailto:fieldguide@opennews.org). You'll find Markdown and HTML lesson plan templates in the project's [templates](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/field-guide-security-training-newsroom/tree/master/templates) directory.

### Add new resources and glossary items
Chapter 3 includes a glossary and links to existing security resources, to complement and extend the topics covered in our lesson plans. If your favourite links are missing, we'd love to add them! If you're comfortable with GitHub, we welcome Pull Requests and new Issues, or you can also drop us an email anytime.

### Translate and localize the guide
The initial version of the guide was written with North American English-speaking newsrooms in mind, but digital security is important for journalists working in all communities and languages. If you can provide translations of the existing guide resources, or if you'd like to add lesson plans covering topics more relevant to your community, please contact us.

## Reporting errors
