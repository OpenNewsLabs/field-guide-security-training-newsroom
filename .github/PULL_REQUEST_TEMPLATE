Fixes Issue #

- [ ] New Lesson Plan
- [ ] Correction or update to existing plan 
- [ ] New Resource listing


## If this PR contains a new lesson plan:

### What is the tool or process that it describes?
(Example: this lesson plan describes Semaphor, a proprietary messaging tool similar to Signal that can be used to communicate securely)

### What threat model does it assume will apply to users of the tool or process?
(Example: a journalist working on a case involving organized crime in the USA may have information on source identities. This information is valuable to the targets of the investigation. They will have the ability to follow the journalist, physically break in to the journalist's home or office, and contact the journalist and their friends and family and intimidate them with the goal of uncovering source identities. If they get source identities the sources will no longer cooperate with the journalist and will be in physical danger. Semaphor would allow the journalist and sources to communicate securely, which would help to protect their identities.)

### In what circumstances should the tool or process NOT be used?

(Example: If the journalist cannot reasonably ensure the safety of their electronic devices with the Semaphor client, or if the source cannot use Semaphor without arising suspicion.)


## If this PR contains an update to an existing plan:

 - [ ] The update corrects a security error in the plan
 - [ ] The update improves the overall quality of the lesson plan
 - [ ] The update is a minor correction
