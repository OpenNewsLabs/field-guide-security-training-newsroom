# Framing the Conversation

## Overview

Many of the lesson plans in this guide are designed to stand alone, and some of the overview lessons can cover a few key topics in a lunch hour. But if you're thinking about launching a series of workshops, it is worth considering how you want to frame that series.

There are a lot of different ways to frame a conversation about digital security. Many trainers like to start with a review of basic digital literacy, to provide a foundation for subsequent trainings. Others start with threat modeling or risk assessment. This document is a great roundup of places to start a training series.

* For some participants, this workshop will be their first opportunity to reflect on a subject that is conventionally framed as the domain of experts. Facilitating means showing that participants, too, have what they need to participate in the process.

* No workshop starts from scratch. Everyone in the room brings some insight and some baggage. Participants will have useful digital security knowledge, but they also bring personal insecurities and myths that take time to debunk.

* Adults usually expect to understand the relevance of what we learn. That expectation can be challenging when we don’t have existing mental landscapes that help us make sense of new concepts and tools. Facilitating means providing useful frames of reference.

The good news is that a lot of great trainers have already done the hard work of articulating foundational concepts for digital security work that then open the conversation up to other specific practice- and tools-based topics.

Here are examples of lesson plans you might use to facilitate a first session with newsroom colleagues, along with brief explanations of when these framings can be most helpful.

## How the Internet Works

Mariel Garcia and Spyros Monastiriotis' [How the Internet Works](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SmHfpm3Dy2ym9gUJfnA0hA12ytQ3LlW31Y5l_TCJkJo/edit) is a great introductory lesson plan that starts by walking through the basics of how information is stored and flows between devices on the internet. You can then talk about the vulnerable points in the chain—and start a conversation about the related good security practices. The lesson plan is intended for sessions lasting between two and four hours.

Tactical Technology Collective’s [How the Internet Works](https://gendersec.tacticaltech.org/wiki/index.php/Hands_On_How_the_internet_works), and the "How mobile communications work" module on [My Shadow](https://myshadow.org/train) cover similar material in shorter 30-minute activities.

## Assessing Risk

[Internews’ SaferJourno](https://www.internews.org/sites/default/files/resources/SaferJournoGuide_2014-03-21.pdf) includes a nice module on risk assessment (see page 17). [Frontline Defenders Workbook on Security](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/resource-publication/workbook-security-practical-steps-human-rights-defenders-risk) and Tactical Technology Collective’s [visual actor mapping](https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org/exercises/explore/visual-actor-mapping-part-1) session are also good resources for facilitating conversations about risk and risk assessment. These can be good starting points for discussing concrete steps that are important to take.

This framing is most helpful in an environment where participants are working closely together and share common risks.

## Where Your Data Lives

[The Data Backup Matrix](https://level-up.cc/curriculum/protecting-data/data-backup-basics/activity-discussion/data-backup-matrix-creating-information-map/), a Level Up activity, asks participants to reflect on the places where their data is stored by facilitating creation of an "information map." This exercise is based on the idea that understanding what exactly is at stake in a digital security crisis and what the least and most vulnerable points are will enable subsequent risk assessment and tool learning.

This framing can be particularly helpful when working with groups that have had other digital security trainings but never really changed any of their practices, as this exercise can help them re-engage with the importance of better practices in their particular cases. This activity is intended for a session lasting 30 to 45 minutes.

## A Day in Your Life

Tactical Technology Collective’s [A day in your life](https://gendersec.tacticaltech.org/wiki/index.php/Holistic_security_-_A_day_in_your_life) asks participants to create a timeline, or a time-based "information map". The exercise is based on the idea that thinking about the times you are most vulnerable can help participants prioritize changes they want to make as they build digital security skills.

This framing is helpful for groups where individual analysis is most appropriate, and when working with groups that have had other digital security trainings but never really changed any of their practices, as this exercise can help them re-engage with the importance of better practices in their particular cases. The activity is intended for a session lasting an hour.

## Tracking – Who's Collecting Our Data? How? And Why?

Tactical Technology Collective’s [My Shadow](https://myshadow.org/train) includes a few great  activities and workshops crafted around the idea that people can more easily make sense of best practices if they start by talking about services people already use and the data that is being collected.

This framing is particularly useful in newsrooms that cover low-risk topics but are interested in building digital security capacity. The activities are divided into 30-minute modules, which you should complement with discussions on the topic.

## Reflecting on Existing Security Practices

[This holistic security exercise](https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org/exercises/prepare/1-1-reflecting-on-existing-security-practices) by Tactical Technology Collective is based on the idea that people are not really starting from scratch in terms of security, even if they are coming to their first training. Exploring previous knowledge and practices is a good way of making the entire process more relevant for them.

This exercise isn't meant to be a stand-alone session, and can be a good warmup for a longer skill-based session.

## Integrated Security

Some digital security trainers have used Kvinna's [integrated security facilitation approach](http://www.integratedsecuritymanual.org/sites/default/files/samplestructure_0.pdf), based on the idea that collective discussions on what security means and the practices we already take to protect ourselves are a good way to continue building our security capacity.

This framing can be helpful in newsrooms where security needs are much broader than what is typically covered in digital security curriculum. The lesson plan is intended for a session lasting two to four hours.

## This is Awesome

Customize it, bring in some of your favorite properties of the net, etc.

Practical privacy and security is just a part of digital literacy. Right now, for most people, learning how their computers work seems hard enough, learning how the network works seems impossible. But it's not, it's just learning a new perspective about the world we live in everyday.

It's worthwhile to take a moment to say how amazing the age we live in is, how wonderful and awesome it is, and downright magical it is, living through the mediation of just about everything. At the turn of the century we didn't have 30-second access to all human knowledge, now we can't tolerate being out of touch with the world for more than a few hours. We used to go to the library to find things out. When someone moved away, we accepted that we'd probably never see from or hear from them again. The lives of people in distant lands, or even Des Moines, was mysterious.

Now, if we want to talk to hundreds, or even thousands, of people, we can turn to Twitter, or a host of other platforms. Networks with equivalent reach and ease of access simply didn't exist for previous generations. Someone could work for years to get onto a platform with that kind of reach, but that was a career choice -- go to college, try to get a job, work for it, possibly for most of their life. Now it's a regular part of life, normal and even banal.

There are more books than we could hope to read, much less own, that fit on a three-inch screen. Or, realizing that reading on a 3" screen sucks,  we can turn to audiobooks, of which there are more than we could ever listen to -- even in the public domain, having been read by random volunteers! Thanks, random volunteers!

We can book a flight to Seoul, order a box of baby chickens, and find patient communities for dozens ofrare diseases in the span of 20 minutes, all from a magical phone in our pockets, or a small box with more computational power than took humanity to the moon.

We live in an age of working magic wands, an age with no muggles. We're all wizards now -- but there's no Hogwarts. We're muddling through, and everyone having all these powers can seem scary. But the world gets better as we all learn to use them.

This is digital literacy, getting a sense of your networks. Learning how to use your network powers, and how to defend yourself in an environment of network powers.

Contexts in which this framing can be helpful: when you want to set a tone that none of this should be scary or overwhelming.

## Understanding and Honoring Needs and Expectations

DJ and Nicolás Sera-Leyva have written extensively about understanding and managing expectations in digital security trainings at [Level Up](https://www.level-up.cc/you-the-trainer/setting-expectations-for-participants-organizers-and-yourself/). Communicating with participants, rather than relying entirely on what a trainer *thinks* they need and expect, will make any training more effective.

The first session is great to help get the whole group in sync, which sometimes means identifying the expectations that should be kindly adjusted so that we do not get caught up in promises we cannot keep. DJ and Nicolás offer the following messages to address some of the most common expectation-reality gaps in digital security trainings:

* There is no such thing as perfect security.
* There is no such thing as a permanent digital security solution.
* You are as secure as the most "un-secure" person you connect with online.

A few more valuable points to keep in mind:

* Digital security is not just about knowledge: it is also about changing habits. Nobody changes all of their habits based on one two-hour session. Encourage participants to make realistic commitments, and keep them.
* Security is an effort we make for ourselves, for others we care about, and also for others we currently do not care about. We rely on each other -- security might be an act of moral obligation, civic responsibility, or love.
* Normalizing secure communications is a way to work in solidarity with more vulnerable groups. As more people use encrypted channels to touch base about what's for dinner, we all help make secure communication normal.

Many of the "framing" suggestions above start with activities that incorporate (or can be easily tweaked to incorporate) these conversations, and Chris Michael published [a very useful resource for getting participants in sync](https://level-up.cc/you-the-trainer/first-3-sessions-of-your-event/developing-a-shared-brain/).
