The Field Guide to Security Training in the Newsroom
====================================================

Did The Intercept just burn a source? Does that Yahoo hack mean that you
need to change all your passwords? In the weeks following the 2016
presidential election, daily downloads of Signal increased four-fold.
Though the US Border Patrol has had the authority to search electronic
devices at border crossings for almost a decade, they seem to be using
that authority more often in recent months. With the inauguration of a
president who is openly hostile to the press, reporters on all kinds of
beats have started to ask how to protect their digital data and how to
advocate for better policy and infrastructure throughout the newsroom.

Often the person they turn to for help has to come up with smart answers
on the fly. They’re the one developer who uses GPG, or the reporter
who’s been trying to convince everyone else to install Signal—and now
they’re suddenly pressed into service as the newsroom security expert.
Or they’re the IT staffer tasked with keeping the mail servers running,
only now they’re also the in-house opsec consultant who doesn’t have any
formal training in what reporters and editors need.

About This Guide
----------------

This resource collects the advice and experience of journalists,
newsroom developers, and security experts, organized into a set of
lessons and training materials available for newsroom staff who find
themselves leading security trainings. In a moment when reporters are
asking how to protect themselves and their sources, we want to see a
more people armed to answer those questions and help newsrooms
communicate and store data more securely.

The curriculum is hosted by `OpenNews <https://opennews.org/>`__, a team
that helps developers, designers, and data analysts convene and
collaborate on open journalism projects, and `BuzzFeed Open
Lab <https://www.buzzfeed.com/openlab>`__, an arts and technology
fellowship program at BuzzFeed News. The first draft began during a
two-day event in June 2017, with about 20 people working in-person and
remote.


We’ve organized this guide into three key sections.
Chapter 1 is an enormous resource for new trainers or folks who are
looking for ways to be better at training, in general. We’ve written
this with a newsroom audience in mind, and we’ve pooled a lot of
valuable resources that already exist in the world.

Chapter 3 is our best effort to aggregate links to the best existing
resources, to help new trainers deepen their own expertise.

This is a community resource, and it gets better every time anyone from
the journalism and security communities shares advice, writes up a new
lesson, asks a question, or even just spots a typo. We'd love to add
your expertise to this project.
