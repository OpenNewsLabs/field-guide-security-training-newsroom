**Training Newsrooms on Two-factor Authentication (June 2017)**

(Loosely adapted from [*Two-Factor Authentication for
Newsrooms*](https://source.opennews.org/articles/two-factor-authentication-newsrooms/))

One of the most important things your team can do to step up
authentication . Encourage your audience to use a second piece of
information - a second “factor” - to secure their account. This
information is typically a short code (e.g., generated on your phone),
generated by physical hardware. We call this two-factor authentication
(2FA, for short).

Sometimes you’ll hear it related names such as “2-step,” or
“multi-factor” but these are tied back to the same basic idea.

Your audience might be concerned that 2FA will lock them out of their
account when they lose track of their authentication device, such as
their phone. Don’t worry! We’ll talk about ways to recover accounts in
case of emergency.

Two-factor authentication can help your team protect many of your
account logins -- Slack, Dropbox, and so on. Along with using unique
passwords, it’s especially important to use 2FA on your primary email
accounts. Why? If an attacker gets into your primary email, they can
reset the password or recover other connected accounts.

You can lean on two resources to help your audience set up two-factor
authentication.

-   Check if your favorite service supports it on
    > [*Twofactorauth.org*](https://twofactorauth.org/)

-   Look for step-by-step guides on
    > [*TurnOn2FA.com*](https://www.turnon2fa.com/tutorials/).

There are a few easy, widely supported approaches for adding 2FA to your
accounts, and each has unique considerations for security and
convenience.

-   SMS text messages

-   Authenticator apps

-   Security keys

Know these three approaches, their advantages, and tradeoffs, and spend
some time introducing them to your audience.

**A Pretty Good Option: SMS Text Messages**\
When setting up 2FA, most services allow regular old text messages. When
logging in, they’ll send a short confirmation code on your mobile
device. When prompted during login, you enter the code.

Text messages are a painless way to access 2FA codes, but are only as
reliable as the phone network. For example, if you lose network access
or travel outside the country, you might not be able to receive the
messages.

SMS-based 2FA is much better than using a password alone, telephone
infrastructure comes with a

[*baggage*](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2016/04/23/sms-phishing-attackers-continue-pursue-apple-users/)
that makes it vulnerable to interception. In other words, SMS isn’t the
most secure method available for targeted groups or individuals.

One example you can use:\
An attacker broke into the Twitter and email accounts of a prominent
Black Lives Matter activist, Deray McKesson, by convincing Verizon to
redirect his phone messages to a new SIM card on a remote device. This
allowed the attacker to intercept his 2FA messages.

![](media/image14.png){width="5.208333333333333in"
height="3.3333333333333335in"}

The attacker had DeRay’s password already. 2FA forced them to work much
harder, but again, SMS is not the best option. So let’s look to another
2FA method.

Authenticator apps are a little more convenient, and a lot more secure.\
\
**Better Option: Authentication Apps**\
Some services allow you to receive your temporary login code from a
mobile app. There are many options to choose from, such as [*Google
Authenticator*](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en),
[*Authy*](https://authy.com/), [*Duo Mobile*](https://guide.duo.com/),
and others.

height="2.530333552055993in"}\
\
Some web services let you attach multiple authentication apps to the
same account, which can be incredibly helpful for getting login codes
when multiple people need access. Authenticator apps are also great
because they work when you don’t have access to your phone network
(e.g., when traveling internationally).\
\
Unlike SMS messages, authenticator apps can’t be intercepted on the
phone network, making apps a hardened option.\
\
**Even Better Option: Security Keys**\
Right now, security keys are one of the most secure and efficient ways
to use 2FA. A security key is a physical USB device you can use to
authenticate into your account.

They’re pretty cheap — one of the most popular options, a
[*Yubikey*](https://www.yubico.com/) costs
[*\$18*](https://www.amazon.com/Yubico-Y-123-FIDO-U2F-Security/dp/B00NLKA0D8/).

When prompted to provide your 2FA credentials, instead of typing in a
code, you simply insert your security key and physically tap it when
prompted during login.

Security keys are fairly resistant to phishing attacks, making them one
of the best options available. Unlike code-based 2FA, phishing sites
don’t have a great way to intercept information from security keys. If
you were to land on a phishing site with an illegitimate URL domain
(e.g., faceboook.com instead of facebook.com), the key will not
cooperate with the website.

Security keys are not yet as well supported as authenticator apps, but
the standard is getting traction on large websites. It can be used to
log into Google, Facebook, Dropbox, and other services. If you’re using
Google to manage your email, however, or other supportive services,
security keys are a great option.

Security keys for web require [*browser
support*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor), and the
Yubikey works with [*Opera*](https://www.opera.com/) and [*Google
Chrome*](https://www.google.com/chrome/). Many other popular browsers
are working to integrate support for Yubikeys and similar authentication
devices.

Encourage your audience to use whichever 2FA method is available and
practical. [*SMS-based 2FA is a worthwhile
upgrade*](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/youre-probably-fine-with-sms-based-two-factor-authentication),
and it’s absolutely better than going without. But strongly nudge them
toward hardened options, such as authenticator apps or security keys

**Set it up together**\
Consider using an example to demonstrate how easy it is to set up 2FA,
or give the audience a resource to look at for step-by-step directions.
You can demonstrate how straightforward it is to set up 2FA with Gmail.
Alternatively, see
[*TurnOn2FA.com*](https://www.turnon2fa.com/tutorials/) for more
examples.

Setting up 2FA should not take more than 10 minutes.

Time to break out the laptops. Open up the browser of your choice, and
show everyone how to navigate to the Gmail setup page.\
\
Account icon (top right) > My Account > Sign-in & security >
Signing in to Google > 2-Step Verification > Get started

\
First, users must enter their phone number to register the device.
They’ll be sent a confirmation code on the device, and they can enter it
on the registration page. If someone prefers not to use their phone
number, it can be removed later.\
\
After registering your device, they will be able to receive 2FA codes
through SMS text messages.\
\
**Authenticator App**\
For a more secure way to use 2FA, some services allow you to receive
your temporary login code in an authenticator app. There are many
options to choose from, such as [*Google
Authenticator*](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en),
[*Authy*](https://authy.com/), [*Duo Mobile*](https://guide.duo.com/),
and others. Have them download one of these apps.\
\
For Gmail, in the 2-step verification page, scroll down to
“Authenticator app” and click “Set up.” To register a new service in the
app, users are asked to scan a barcode that appears on their screen.
After the code appears in the app, they will type the code into the
setup prompt.\
\
**Security Keys**

First need to purchase a security key, such as a Yubikey
([*\$18*](https://www.amazon.com/Yubico-Y-123-FIDO-U2F-Security/dp/B00NLKA0D8/)).
They’re pretty easy to set up.\
\
Scroll down to “Security keys” and click “Add security key.” When
prompted, insert the key into the USB port, and physically tap the gold
disk on top.

Afterward, name the newly-registered device. During log in, instead of
typing in a 2FA code, anyone who sets this up can just insert and tap
the key.

![](media/image10.gif)\
\
After setting up authenticator apps or security keys, they probably
don’t need SMS any more. Show them how to scroll down to “Voice or text
message” and click the pencil icon, and then click “Remove phone.”\
\
Note: Some new computers (e.g., the 2016 Macbook) only have USB Type-C
ports. If you can’t use a traditional USB 2.0 or 3.0 port, you can still
use security keys with a USB Type-C adapter. [*Here’s a short list of
Type-C adapters that are confirmed to
work*](https://www.yubico.com/support/knowledge-base/categories/articles/how-do-i-use-a-yubikey-with-usb-c-adapters/).
It’s a little more expensive to purchase [*Type-C
Yubikeys*](https://www.yubico.com/product/yubikey-4-series/#yubikey-4c).\
\
**Encourage Backup Codes**\
The audience might wonder what will happen if they lose access to their
2FA device. Won’t they get locked out? Even if we lose our security key
and authenticator app, backup codes will allow you to get back into your
account. In case of emergency, you can enter your password and use one
of these codes instead of a 2FA code.

For Gmail, have your audience scroll down to “Backup codes” and click
“set up.”

\
They should see a series of numeric codes. It’s generally wise to have
these printed out, so encourage the audience to keep these codes
someplace where they can be physically accessed. Think of them a bit
like passwords -- information you wouldn’t want to leave in plain sight.

**Questions about 2FA use for teams**\
So far we’ve only talked about situations where one person needs to log
into an account, and they alone hold onto their authentication device.\
\
But newsrooms often share login information, and chances are, more than
one person has access to the Twitter account.\
\
The audience might wonder, do 2FA users need to ask for permission to
use your colleague’s phone every time you want to log in?\
\
Some services allow you to attach multiple apps or phone numbers to the
account, while others don’t. For example, Google doesn’t permit users to
register more than one authenticator app at a time, but does allow more
than one phone number. By comparison, Twitter allows more than one app.

Congratulations! You’ve all set up two-factor authentication together.
