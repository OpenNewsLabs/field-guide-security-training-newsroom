## Part 4: Pathways and Choosing Lesson Plans

There is a lot of material in this guide -- don’t feel like you have to use it all, and don’t feel like you have to use it all in order. As you make your way through digital security landscape (or playground, or jungle, or hell) here are some ways to think about paving the path that works for your newsroom: 

When we design a digital security route, we are making decisions based on different factors: our thoughts on possible final destinations, the amount of time we have, the general current capabilities and needs of our participants, and the relationship and trust we have (or don’t yet have) with them.

Here are some considerations that can help decide on your own routes:

* First things first: starting points. We cannot assume that everybody will be starting at the same place; we need to provide guidance so that everyone can get to a common starting point from which we can walk together.
    * Ask about their needs and expectations, and choose the framing for your first session that resonates with you the most (read more on that [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aa9iazU-viaPEPHjy35gK7KGNlFXBW9-9_2RyPUBD_4/edit))
    * Give some thought to ways you can bring different levels of skill together in your process. For example: pairing up those who are more confident and faster in learning about digital security with those who are getting started can help keep an even pace.
* What is more important in your decision: the amount of time you’ll walk together or your destination?
    * Amount of time: "We can meet only once every three weeks", "we want a two-day workshop but no further engagement"
    * Destination: "We want the entire newsroom to do all internal communications in secure channels, and to have a process in place for source protection", "we want everyone to secure their email use".

You can’t have your cake and eat it too. There is no way you can get everyone to learn every tool and change all their habits in two days. So if two days is all you’ll get, choose a more realistic destination. Or, if you have buy-in to be ambitious in your goals, choose a more realistic time-frame.

Less can be more. Rather than trying to cram everything into a marathon, break the goals down into walks that build on each other. For example:

#### The "I just want to cover mobile" pathway

* Session 1: Checking the security settings on mobile apps
* Session 2: Locking Down Mobile Devices
* Session 1: Backing up your mobile device

#### The "We want everyone to secure their email use" pathway

* Session 1: How the internet works - vulnerabilities and opportunities
* Session 2: Secure email overview that builds on session 1; secure passwords
* Session 3: Phishing
* Session 4: Two-factor authentication
* Session 5: Email encryption
* Session 6: Encryption follow-up

Agree on the amount of communication you all think it will be realistic to have in between your walks. Delegating topics to homework to be completed away from the session is a tempting way out of the difficulties of the pedagogic design process, especially if you or the group make promises that cannot be kept. Be realistic and treat that time with the same minimalism and respect with which you should be treating the session itself!
