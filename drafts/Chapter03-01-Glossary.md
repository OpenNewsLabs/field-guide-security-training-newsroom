# Glossary

There are a lot of different ways to talk about some of the underlying topics, and the explanation that really clicks is different for every person. This is less a glossary than a round-up of great analogies and explanations. These are simplified explanations of technical concepts for non-techinical users, 

possibly with links to helpful analogies or in-depth material.

These are good ways to talk about security topics. Aka: analogies we love.

Let's start at the beginning: What is a network?

## What is a network

define for trainer -- A network is two or more nodes connected physically and informationally over time.

What do networks see when they look at you?

examples:
* Path data for cellphones
* Electrical grids
* Social graphs
* Road systems
* John Snow's cholera map
* Packet switching diagram

Think about what a network sees when it sees you. On some you look like a billing point, little more than an amount of money owed, with a individual ID number. On some you look like a series of paths:â€Šthink about cell phone towers and ATM withdrawals. In a medical network, you look like a series of diagnoses, vital statistics, and a place where medical professional time and drugs vanish. That's what the you-shaped hole in that network looks like. To the electrical grid your house looks like a point where power vanishes and money comes out. On a smart grid, that portrait is a little more complex. What do you look like on a phone network? You look like data, metadata, and paths from tower to tower. Time stamps, locations, and connections out to nodes on the internet tell the story of your day, and much of your life.

Network surveillance is often vital to make our lives good and healthy, or to simply build this. Most surveillance, good or bad, is built on how networks operate on the physical level. They're not nefarious, they're physics.

We live with and in networks every minute of every day. These networks lay over each other and touch all over the place. Once we start thinking about them, what they're shaped like, where we are in them, our contemporary world starts to make more sense.

The net is a packet switching network. Packet switching is rather like passing notes in class, you hand the note to someone near you, who tries to hand it to someone closer to the person it's intended for. To know where to pass the note, a person has to know who it's going to, and they know who gave it to them. This knowledge is called metadata: the data a network needs to function.

## What is Authentication

The passwords lesson is a great resource for explaining the process of authentication.
