Backing up your mobile device
=============================

Creating regular, secure backups of data on your mobile devices is important, whether you want to protect against loss, theft, or catastrophic user error (eg. accidentally wiping your device while encrypting it). This session will cover the creation of encrypted backups for iOS and Android users, and make recommendations on a backup schedule. Even if you don't get on a regular schedule, you should always backup your phone before you make any major changes to it.

Getting everyone started backing up their phones is a great way to make sure everyone leaves a workshop with something solidly accomplished.

**ABOUT THIS LESSON PLAN**

**Lesson duration:** This should take under an hour.

**What materials will participants need?** Any phones or tablets they want to protect.

**What materials will the instructor need?** If you don’t already know
the group well, make sure you’ve checked in about their technical
capacity and confirmed that no one is running an unexpected OS.



**Level:** Intro

**LESSON PLAN**

This isn't a super interactive lesson.

Read [EFF on Harm Reduction](https://sec.eff.org/articles/harm-reduction) -- it's an important perspective to keep in mind here. And remember that it is fine to just acknowledge it when you're [out of scope](https://sec.eff.org/articles/out-of-scope).

Everyone should take stock of what is actually on their phone that isn't already backed up. Most of us are syncing calendars and contacts with Nextcloud or Google or iCloud or iTunes already, but if anyone isn't, start there.

Where you back your work up depends a lot on your values and threat model. For some folks, the risk of losing all their data outweighs their discomfort with handing over evermore personal data to Google or Apple. For other folks, setting up a private and encrypted Nextcloud instance with DroidDav is a reasonable proposition. And some folks like to start over with a clean slate from time to time -- they're fine not backing up at all.

From there, everyone's backup strategy is going to be different. Take a look at the apps you rely on: what do they store and how often do you need to back them up?
