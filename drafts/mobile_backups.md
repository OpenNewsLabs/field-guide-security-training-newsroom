Backing up your mobile device
=============================

Creating regular, secure backups of data on your mobile devices is important, whether you want to protect against loss, theft, or catastrophic user error (eg. accidentally wiping your device while encrypting it). This session will cover the creation of encrypted backups for iOS and Android users, and make recommendations on a backup schedule. Even if you don't get on a regular schedule, you should always backup your phone before you make any major changes to it.

Getting everyone started backing up their phones is a great way to make sure everyone leaves a workshop with something solidly accomplished.

**ABOUT THIS LESSON PLAN**

**Review date:** Dec 5, 2017

**Lesson duration:** This should take under an hour.


**What materials will participants need?** Any phones or tablets they want to protect.

**What materials will the instructor need?** If you don’t already know
the group well, make sure you’ve checked in about their technical
capacity and confirmed that no one is running an unexpected OS.

**Level:** Intro

**Sample Messaging **

**Links in the news**

\[ as many links as we think are useful to illustrate this concept or
need for security \]

**Advance email**


  > Colleagues,

  >  If you're starting to think about taking digital privacy more seriously, backing up your phone is a great place to start. If you don't already back up your phone regularly, you should probably come to our privacy brown bag and learn how to set up regular backups on your phone. Bring your phone!


**Followup email**

\[ at least one possible email that a trainer could follow up with. It
should include:

+ a recap of the key points so participants can refer back to it,

+ some outside reference links for context

BuzzFeed's Nicole Nguyen has a nice [round up of backup apps](https://www.buzzfeed.com/nicolenguyen/what-to-do-if-your-phones-storage-is-full)

+ a followup exercise. Eg. “Thanks for coming to the peanut butter
sandwich brown bag session. I’m attaching a link to an excellent YouTube
video about spreading techniques. We talked about using a knife,
choosing jams that spread well, and how to think about bread. Your
homework is to make at least one sandwich with creamy PB and one with
crunchy and report back to me by Tuesday on how that went.” \]

**LESSON PLAN**
Everyone should take stock of what is actually on their phone that isn't already backed up. Most of us are syncing calendars and contacts with OwnCloud or Google or iCloud or iTunes already, but if you aren't, start there!
