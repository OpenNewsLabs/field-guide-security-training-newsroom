# Setting the Stage for Your First Session

<!-- This is really a guide to a few places to start introducing and framing digital security. -->

## Overview
There are a lot of stages to building digital security capacity in a newsroom, so you have to start *somewhere*. If you only run one session, it will still count as the start of the process for the newsroom. For trainers who are just getting started, choosing where and how to begin a facilitation process can feel incredibly daunting; it doesn't help that experienced trainers tend to have passionate feelings about where to start.

Our guide to [Being Better Trainer](docs/Chapter01-01-BeingABetterTrainer.md) is a great resource, whatever your experience level. But the first session is an opportunity to think about how you will frame conversations so that they really do serve as a starting point for further work.

Many trainers like to start with a review of basic digital literacy, to give a foundation to the rest of the work they're doing in subsequent trainings. Other's like to start with threat modeling or risk assessment. Below, we've gathered a variety of great resources to help you frame your trainings.

<!--
 resource discusses considerations that you should have in all of your sessions, but we do think that first sessions can especially serve two purposes: setting a **good framing** that enables further work on digital security capacity building, and **understanding and honoring the needs and expectations of the group with which you will be working**.-->

## Framing

The way you choose to frame the conversations you lead makes an enormous difference.

* For some participants, this workshop will be their first opportunity to reflect on a subject that is conventionally framed as the domain of experts. Facilitating means showing that participants, too, have what they need to participate in the process.

* You won’t be starting from scratch. Everyone in the room will bring some insight and some baggage. Many participants will have some digital security knowledge that can be woven into the process you’re starting, but you will also have to deal with myths that can take a while to debunk, personal insecurities. Facilitating well means challenging the prevalent narratives.

* Adults usually expect understand the relevance of what we learn. That expectation can be challenging when we don’t have existing mental landscapes that help us make sense of new concepts and tools. Facilitating means providing conducive frames of reference.

The good news is that you're not alone. You're actually traveling a well trod path. A lot of really great trainers have already done the hard work of articulating foundational concepts for digital security work that then open the conversation up to other specific practice and tools-based topics. You might notice that none of these foundational approaches is based on encryption, malware, or specific topics like that; those come later, once the framing has been established.

Here are examples of lesson plans that different individuals and organizations use to facilitate their first sessions, and a brief explanation of the framing on which they rely.

## How the Internet Works

Mariel Garcia and Spyros Monastiriotis' [How the Internet Works](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SmHfpm3Dy2ym9gUJfnA0hA12ytQ3LlW31Y5l_TCJkJo/edit) is a great introductory lesson plan that starts by walking through the basics of how information is stored and flows between devices on the internet. You can then talk about the vulnerable points in the chain – and start a conversation about the related good security practices. The lesson plan is intended for sessions lasting between two and four hours.

Tactical Technology Collective’s [How the Internet Works](https://gendersec.tacticaltech.org/wiki/index.php/Hands_On_How_the_internet_works), and the "How mobile communications work" module on [My Shadow](https://myshadow.org/train) cover similar material in shorter 30-minute activities.

## Assessing Risk

[Internews’ SaferJourno](https://www.internews.org/sites/default/files/resources/SaferJournoGuide_2014-03-21.pdf) includes a nice module on risk assessment (see page 17), [Frontline Defenders Workbook on Security](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/resource-publication/workbook-security-practical-steps-human-rights-defenders-risk), and Tactical Technology Collective’s [visual actor mapping](https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org/exercises/explore/visual-actor-mapping-part-1) session are all good resources for facilitating conversations about risk and risk assessment, which can be a good starting point for discussing concrete steps that are important to take.

This framing is most helpful in an environment where participants are working closely together and share common risks.

## Where Your Data Lives

[The Data Backup Matrix](https://level-up.cc/curriculum/protecting-data/data-backup-basics/activity-discussion/data-backup-matrix-creating-information-map/), a Level Up activity, asks participants to reflect on the places where their data is stored by facilitating creation of an "information map". This exercise is based on the idea that understanding what exactly is at stake in a digital security crisis and what the least and most vulnerable points are will enable subsequent risk assessment and tool learning.

This framing can be particularly helpful when working with groups that have had other digital security trainings but never really changed any of their practices, as this exercise can help them re-engage with the importance of better practices in their particular cases. This activity is intended for a session lasting 30 to 45 minutes.

## A Day in Your Life

Tactical Technology Collective’s [A day in your life](https://gendersec.tacticaltech.org/wiki/index.php/Holistic_security_-_A_day_in_your_life) asks participants to create of a timeline, or a time-based "information map". The exercise is based on the idea that thinking about the times you are most vulnerable can help participants prioritize changes they want to make as they start building on their digital security skills.

This framing is most helpful for groups where individual analysis is most appropriate, and when working with groups that have had other digital security trainings but never really changed any of their practices, as this exercise can help them re-engage with the importance of better practices in their particular cases. The activity is intended for a session lasting an hour.

## Tracking – Who's collecting our data? How? And why?

Tactical Technology Collective’s [My Shadow](https://myshadow.org/train) includes a few great  activities and workshops crafted around the idea that people can more easily make sense of best practices if they start by talking about services people already use and the data that is being collected.

This framing is particularly useful in newsrooms that cover low-risk topics but are interested in building digital security capacity. The planned activities that are available are divided into 30-minute modules, which you should complement with discussions on the topic.

## Reflecting on Existing Security Practices

[This holistic security exercise](https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org/exercises/prepare/1-1-reflecting-on-existing-security-practices) by Tactical Technology Collective is based on the idea that people are not really starting from scratch in terms of security, even if they are coming to their first training. Exploring previous knowledge and practices is a good way of making the entire process more relevant for them.

This exercise isn't meant to be a stand-alone session, and can be a good warmup for a longer skill-based session.

## Integrated Security

Some digital security trainers have used Kvinna till Kvinna’s [integrated security facilitation approach](http://www.integratedsecuritymanual.org/sites/default/files/samplestructure_0.pdf) based on the idea that collective discussions on what security means and the practices we already take to protect ourselves are a good way to continue building our security capacity.

Contexts in which this framing can be helpful: when working in newsrooms where security needs are much broader than what is typically covered in digital security curriculum. The lesson plan is intended for a session lasting between two and four hours.

## Understanding and Honoring Needs and Expectations

DJ and Nicolás Sera-Leyva have already written a lot about understanding and managing expectations in digital security trainings over at [Level Up](https://www.level-up.cc/you-the-trainer/setting-expectations-for-participants-organizers-and-yourself/). We really want to stress the idea that communicating with participants, rather than relying entirely on what we *think* they need and expect, will help increase the usefulness of our efforts.

The first session is great to help us get the whole group in sync, which sometimes means identifying the expectations that should be kindly adjusted so that we do not get caught up in promises we cannot keep. DJ and Nicolás offer the following messages to address some of the most common expectation-reality gaps in digital security trainings:

* There is no such thing as perfect security.
* There is no such thing as a permanent digital security solution.
* You are as secure as the most "un-secure" person you connect with online.

And we add the following:

* Digital security is not just about learning new things, but about changing habits, and nobody changes all of their habits because they go to a two-hour session. What are the realistic commitments we want to make?
* Security is an effort we make for ourselves, for others we care about, and also for others we currently do not care about. Because we rely on each other. See it as an act of moral obligation, civic responsibility, or love.
* Everyone has individual needs and different starting points, and we can get to explore some of them in the group setting, but if we are working in an organizational setting, the threat models that address all the participants must be prioritized. Some boundaries will be set to keep the session relevant for everyone.

How can we have those conversations at the start? Surveys before workshops are a great way, but they are not the only option. Some of the lesson plans discussed in the previous section start with activities that incorporate (or can be easily tweaked to incorporate) these conversations, and Chris Michael published [this very useful resource for that](https://level-up.cc/you-the-trainer/first-3-sessions-of-your-event/developing-a-shared-brain/). Even if you decide to do a lecture because you cannot ensure a participatory format, you can build-in a short interactive part of the session at the beginning to ask people about what they expect about the session.

Now, what are some of those conversation prompts? Some questions you can use:

* What is your previous experience with digital security topics? Saying "none" is okay!
* What brings you to this workshop?
* Has anybody been to a digital security session before?
* At the end of this session, what would you like to walk away with? How about at the end of the process, when we have completed all our sessions?
* What have you heard people say about digital security on the media or in your social circles?
* Do you have any digital security tips or things you already do?
* What are some of your most pressing questions in terms of digital security?

And then what? If you do this in-session, rather than before, *maybe* you won’t be able to produce a new session agenda from scratch on the spot, but taking notes of what is said can help you tweak your examples and language as you go through the session as you originally planned it (to especially address the points that were raised), and will help you in the planning of future sessions.

This can also help you figure out any arrangements that you need to make to get everyone in sync. For example: if you have people with more experience, or with technical backgrounds, you can give them extra tasks to keep their attention and promote their growth: you can pair them up in some sections so they can mentor their peers, or they can participate as note-takers or designated [jargon ball throwers](https://www.level-up.cc/you-the-trainer/be-a-better-trainer/).
