# Chapter 1
## Part 3: Your First Session

There are a lot of stages in building digital security capacity in the newsroom, and helping colleagues go through all of them will most likely mean running (way) a series of sessions that have to start *somewhere*. Or, if your resources only allow you to run one, it will still count as the start of the process for the newsroom. Now: The First Digital Security Session is an event that elicits strong sensations and even stronger opinions among facilitators. For those who are just getting started, choosing where and how to begin a facilitation process can feel incredibly daunting; for those who have had many firsts, a collection of glories and fails can lead to passionate judgements about what the most conducive first sessions look like.

The [How To Be A Better Trainer]() page of this resource discusses considerations that you should have in all of your sessions, but we do think that first sessions can especially serve two purposes: setting a **good framing** that enables further work on digital security capacity building, and **understanding and honoring the needs and expectations of the group with which you will be working**.

### First session framings (and lesson plans)

Before we get to the actual lesson plans that you can use in your first session, we want to explain why framings matter, especially in your first session:

* For some of the session participants, it will be a rare or even the first opportunity to formally reflect on a topic that, while now prevalent in public discourse, has traditionally been framed as accessible only to those with technical backgrounds. Facilitating means showing that participants, too, have what they need to participate in the process.
* You won’t be starting a conversation from scratch: at best, people will have some digital security knowledge that can be woven into the process you’re starting; at worst, you will have to deal with existing moral panics, myths that can take a while to debunk, personal insecurities and fear of the unknown, and other fun components of public perceptions on digital security. Facilitating means challenging the prevalent narratives.
* As adults, we need to understand the relevance of what we are learning, and that can be hard when we don’t have existing mental landscapes that help us make sense of new concepts and tools. Facilitating means providing conducive frames of reference.

The good news is that it does not have to be your job to think of these framings. Many people have worked on this and now we have different options that articulate foundational concepts for digital security work that then open the conversation up to other specific practice and tools-based topics (because, you will notice, none of this framings is based on encryption, malware, or any specific topics like that; those come later, once the framings have been established). 

Here are examples of lesson plans that different individuals and organizations use to facilitate their first sessions, and a brief explanation of the framing on which they rely.

#### How the internet works

Mariel and Spyros’ [How the Internet Works introductory lesson plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SmHfpm3Dy2ym9gUJfnA0hA12ytQ3LlW31Y5l_TCJkJo/edit) is based on the idea that, by promoting a basic understanding how information is stored flows between devices on the internet, you can then talk about the vulnerable points in the chain – and thus start a conversation about the related good security practices.

Contexts in which this framing can be helpful: when working with newsrooms where levels of technological "literacy" are very disparate, or where some of the participants would identify as being “not very tech savvy”. It can also be useful in working with participants that come in with very mixed concerns, as it encompasses many of them and can help them all find something relevant to their own interests. The lesson plan is intended for sessions lasting between two and four hours.

If you want the framing but not the full session, you can use Tactical Technology Collective’s How the internet works, or How mobile communications work modules on [My Shadow](https://myshadow.org/train) for 30-minute activities.

#### Assessing risk

Internews’ SaferJourno [module for session one](http://saferjourno.internews.org/pdf/SaferJourno_Guide.pdf#page=17) (see page 17), [this activity](https://web.archive.org/web/20150802032206/http://frontlinedefenders.org/files/workbook_eng.pdf#page=18) by Front Line Defenders (see page 18, and don’t forget to read Appendix 3), and Tactical Technology Collective’s [visual actor mapping](https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org/exercises/explore/visual-actor-mapping-part-1) session, are based on the idea that understanding the risks that journalists face, and putting them into perspective, will then open up the discussion about steps that can be taken in the newsroom.

Contexts in which this framing can be helpful: when you are working in a group with some shared characteristics (they belong to the same newsroom) but who have different levels of expertise; when working with newsrooms that, for some reason or another, have already started having conversations about security, and where your digital security capacity building efforts fit into a larger process that is already underway. The SaferJourno lesson plan is intended for a session lasting two and a half hours, and that is a good time estimate for Front Line Defenders session as well.

#### Where your data lives (information mapping, by space)

[The Data Backup Matrix](https://level-up.cc/curriculum/protecting-data/data-backup-basics/activity-discussion/data-backup-matrix-creating-information-map/), a Level Up activity, gets participants to reflect on the spaces where their data is stored by facilitating the creation of an "information map". This exercise is based on the idea that understanding what exactly is at stake in a digital security crisis and what the least and most vulnerable points are, in that regard, will enable subsequent risk assessment and tool learning. 

Contexts in which this framing can be helpful: when you are going into a session without knowing if all participants work or not in the same organization (the activities can easily be adapted to assist in the creation of either individual or organizational information maps); when working with groups that have had other digital security trainings but never really changed any of their practices, as this exercise can help them re-engage with the importance of better practices in their particular cases. This activity is intended for a session lasting 30 to 45 minutes.

#### A day in your life (information mapping, by time)

Tactical Technology Collective’s [A day in your life](https://gendersec.tacticaltech.org/wiki/index.php/Holistic_security_-_A_day_in_your_life) gets participants to reflect on the sources of insecurity they face by facilitating the creation of a timeline, or, if we can call it so, a time-based "information map". This exercise is based on the idea that thinking about the times you feel insecure can help participants pinpoint the priorities to start building on their digital security skills.

Contexts in which this framing can be helpful: when working with freelance journalists, as this activity allows primarily for individual analysis; when working with individuals* *that have had other digital security trainings but never really changed any of their practices, as this exercise can help them re-engage with the importance of better practices in their particular cases. The activity is intended for a session lasting an hour.

#### Tracking – Who's collecting our data? How? And why?

Tactical Technology Collective’s *[My Shado*w](https://myshadow.org/train)[ training page](https://myshadow.org/train) offers this activities and workshops crafted around this starting point, based on the idea that people can more easily make sense of best practices if they start by talking about services people already use and the data that is being collected.

Contexts in which this framing can be helpful: in newsrooms that cover low-risk topics but are interested in building digital security capacity. The planned activities that are available are divided into 30-minute modules, which you should complement with discussions on the topic.

#### Reflecting on existing security practices

[This holistic security exercise](https://holistic-security.tacticaltech.org/exercises/prepare/1-1-reflecting-on-existing-security-practices) by Tactical Technology Collective is based on the idea that people are not really starting from scratch in terms of security, even if they are coming to their first training, and exploring previous knowledge and practices is a good way of making the entire process more relevant for them.

Contexts in which this framing can be helpful: in newsrooms or mixed-organization groups that have previous experience with security trainings, even if they were not digital security per se. The exercise linked above is not intended as a stand-alone session, but rather as an activity for one.

#### Integrated security

Some digital security trainers have used Kvinna till Kvinna’s [integrated security facilitation approach](http://www.integratedsecuritymanual.org/sites/default/files/samplestructure_0.pdf) based on the idea that collective discussions on what security means and the practices we already take to protect ourselves are a good way to continue building our security capacity.

Contexts in which this framing can be helpful: when working in newsrooms where security needs are much broader than what is typically covered in digital security curriculum. The lesson plan is intended for a session lasting between two and four hours.

### Understanding and honoring needs and expectations

DJ and Nicolás Sera-Leyva have already written a lot about understanding and managing expectations in digital security trainings over at [Level Up](https://www.level-up.cc/you-the-trainer/setting-expectations-for-participants-organizers-and-yourself/). We really want to stress the idea that communicating with participants, rather than relying entirely on what we *think* they need and expect, will help increase the usefulness of our efforts. 

The first session is great to help us get the whole group in sync, which sometimes means identifying the expectations that should be kindly adjusted so that we do not get caught up in promises we cannot keep. DJ and Nicolás offer the following messages to address some of the most common expectation-reality gaps in digital security trainings:

* There is no such thing as perfect security.
* There is no such thing as a permanent digital security solution.
* You are as secure as the most "un-secure" person you connect with online.

And we add the following:

* Digital security is not just about learning new things, but about changing habits, and nobody changes all of their habits because they go to a two-hour session. What are the realistic commitments we want to make?
* Security is an effort we make for ourselves, for others we care about, and also for others we currently do not care about. Because we rely on each other. See it as an act of moral obligation, civic responsibility, or love.
* Everyone has individual needs and different starting points, and we can get to explore some of them in the group setting, but if we are working in an organizational setting, the threat models that address all the participants must be prioritized. Some boundaries will be set to keep the session relevant for everyone. 

How can we have those conversations at the start? Surveys before workshops are a great way, but they are not the only option. Some of the lesson plans discussed in the previous section start with activities that incorporate (or can be easily tweaked to incorporate) these conversations, and Chris Michael published [this very useful resource for that](https://level-up.cc/you-the-trainer/first-3-sessions-of-your-event/developing-a-shared-brain/). Even if you decide to do a lecture because you cannot ensure a participatory format, you can build-in a short interactive part of the session at the beginning to ask people about what they expect about the session.

Now, what are some of those conversation prompts? Some questions you can use:

* What is your previous experience with digital security topics? Saying "none" is okay!
* What brings you to this workshop?
* Has anybody been to a digital security session before?
* At the end of this session, what would you like to walk away with? How about at the end of the process, when we have completed all our sessions?
* What have you heard people say about digital security on the media or in your social circles?
* Do you have any digital security tips or things you already do?
* What are some of your most pressing questions in terms of digital security?

And then what? If you do this in-session, rather than before, *maybe* you won’t be able to produce a new session agenda from scratch on the spot, but taking notes of what is said can help you tweak your examples and language as you go through the session as you originally planned it (to especially address the points that were raised), and will help you in the planning of future sessions. 

This can also help you figure out any arrangements that you need to make to get everyone in sync. For example: if you have people with more experience, or with technical backgrounds, you can give them extra tasks to keep their attention and promote their growth: you can pair them up in some sections so they can mentor their peers, or they can participate as note-takers or designated [jargon ball throwers](https://www.level-up.cc/you-the-trainer/be-a-better-trainer/).
