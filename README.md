# The Field Guide to Security Training in the Newsroom


The curriculum is hosted by [OpenNews]<https://opennews.org/>, a team
that helps developers, designers, and data analysts convene and
collaborate on open journalism projects. The first draft was composed  during a
two-day convening in Chicago in June 2017. The curriculum launched publicly in the Spring of 2018.

This is a living resource and we welcome your [contributions](docs/contributing.md) and [feedback](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/field-guide-security-training-newsroom/issues).

Our goal is not to replicate good work that other organizations have already done, so if you know about great training resources for security trainers, we'd love to add those to our [resource roundup](docs/Chapter03-02-Resources.md).

## More ways to contribute

Every lesson plan in Chapter 2 ends with a list of current links in the news that capture the importance of the material covered in that lesson. If your favorite links are missing, we'd love it if you added them.

We also wrap each lesson with links to other lesson plans, from EFF or Freedom of the Press Foundation or elsewhere, that cover the same material for a different audience or with a different approach. If your favorite lesson plans are missing, we'd love it if you added them.

Take a look at the github [issues](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/field-guide-security-training-newsroom/issues) -- there we've captured specific tasks that need to be addressed.
