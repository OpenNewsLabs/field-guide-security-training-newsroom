# The Field Guide to Security Training in the Newsroom

The Field Guide to Security Training in the Newsroom is a round up of resources and lesson plans designed to improve and expand newsroom digital privacy training. 

This curriculum is hosted by [OpenNews](https://opennews.org/), a team that helps developers, designers, and data analysts convene and collaborate on open journalism projects. The first draft was composed during a two-day convening in Chicago in June 2017. The curriculum launched publicly in the Spring of 2018.

This is a living resource and we welcome your [contributions](docs/contributing.md) and [feedback](https://github.com/OpenNewsLabs/field-guide-security-training-newsroom/issues).

Our goal is not to replicate good work that other organizations have already done, so if you know about great training resources for security trainers, we'd love to add those to our [resource roundup](docs/Chapter03-02-Resources.md).
